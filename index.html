      <h2 style="color: darkred;">Immigration</h2>
      <p>Mexican immigration to the United States has a complex history that spans several centuries, influenced by various social, economic, and political factors. Early immigration was driven largely by the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s, which forced many Mexicans to seek safety and opportunities in the U.S. The movement intensified during World War II, when the United States introduced the Bracero Program, which brought Mexican workers to the U.S. to address labor shortages. Over the years, policies and laws have shifted, affecting the rights and opportunities available to Mexican immigrants.</p>

      <h2 style="color: darkred;">Discrimination</h2>
      <p>Discrimination against Mexican Americans has been a persistent issue in the United States, affecting various aspects of life including education, housing, and employment. Mexican Americans were often segregated into separate schools, receiving fewer resources and limited opportunities compared to their white peers. Housing discrimination, often through redlining and other policies, restricted Mexican American families to certain neighborhoods, limiting their social mobility. In the workplace, Mexican Americans frequently faced wage disparities and were often relegated to lower-paying jobs, regardless of their qualifications or skills. These forms of discrimination continue to impact the Mexican American community today, despite progress made over recent decades.</p>

    <!-- Cultural Identity Section -->
    <section id="identity" style="padding: 20px;">
      <h2 style="color: darkred;">Cultural Identity</h2>
      <p>Mexican American cultural identity is a rich blend of Mexican heritage and American influences. Many Mexican Americans retain a deep connection to Mexican traditions, language, and family values, while also embracing American customs and ways of life. This dual identity is often celebrated through cultural events, music, and food, which help Mexican Americans maintain a sense of belonging to their heritage. For instance, celebrations like DÃ­a de los Muertos allow Mexican Americans to honor their ancestors and keep Mexican customs alive. However, balancing these identities can also be challenging, especially when faced with societal pressures to assimilate. This struggle is a central theme in <em>The House on Mango Street</em>, where the protagonist grapples with her cultural identity as she grows up in a Hispanic neighborhood in the U.S.</p>
